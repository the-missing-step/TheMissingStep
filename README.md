# The Missing Step

This repository is the internal workspace for **The Missing Step** — a long-term project focused on building deep intuition in mathematics, probability, and related areas.

The central idea is simple:

> Most people get stuck in math not because the topic is hard,  
> but because one small mental step is skipped or assumed.

This project exists to identify those missing steps and make them explicit.

## What this repository is

- A **thinking space**, not just a content folder  
- A **long-term knowledge base**, not a short project  
- A place where ideas are developed *before* being turned into videos  

Each video on *The Missing Step* corresponds to a folder in this repository containing:
- the core idea
- the reasoning behind it
- visuals, simulations, and code used
- scripts and notes for explanation

Even if a video is never published, the idea still lives here.
