[Opening – Hook | 0:00–0:40]

What is infinity?

Most people will say:
“Infinity means very very large.”
Or “Infinity is the biggest number.”
Or “Infinity is something we can never reach.”

And because of these ideas, questions like these appear:

Why is 1 ÷ 0 not defined, but 1 ÷ very small number becomes infinity?

Why do people say ∞ − ∞ is meaningless?

Why does infinity + 1 still equal infinity?

Today, we are not going to memorize rules.
We are going to build the correct picture of infinity—step by step.

This is The Missing Step.

[Part 1 – Infinity is NOT a number | 0:40–2:30]

Let’s start with the most important correction:

Infinity is not a number.

This one sentence fixes 80% of all confusion.

Numbers behave in certain ways:

You can add them

Subtract them

Compare them

Reach them

Infinity does none of these.

Infinity is an idea, not a number.
It describes a process that never ends, not a value you arrive at.

Think of counting:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …

No matter how far you go, you can always go further.
That never-ending process is what we call infinity.

So infinity does not mean “big”.
It means “unbounded”.

[Part 2 – Potential vs Actual Infinity | 2:30–4:30]

There are two ways infinity appears in mathematics.

1️⃣ Potential Infinity

This is the infinity we meet in counting.

You are never at infinity,
you are moving toward it forever.

Example:

Natural numbers

Time

Distance you can keep adding

This infinity is about process, not existence.

2️⃣ Actual Infinity

This is more subtle.

Here, we treat an infinite collection as a completed object.

Example:

The set of all natural numbers

The set of all real numbers

We don’t list them,
but we accept their existence as a whole.

This distinction matters later when people get confused about paradoxes.

[Part 3 – Infinite ≠ Very Large | 4:30–6:00]

Here is a common mistake:

“If something is extremely large, it is basically infinite.”

No.

Let’s say a number has a trillion digits.
That number is huge.

But it is still finite.

You can:

Add 1 to it

Reach it

Write it (in theory)

Infinity has no last step.

That’s why:

No number “becomes” infinity

Infinity is not waiting at the end of the number line

The number line does not end at infinity.

[Part 4 – Why 1 ÷ 0 is NOT defined | 6:00–8:30]

Now we are ready for the famous question.

Let’s build intuition slowly.

Step 1: Divide by smaller and smaller numbers

0.001
1
	​

=1000

As the denominator gets closer to zero,
the value gets larger and larger.

So people say:

“As x → 0, 1/x → ∞”

This is correct, but notice something important:

👉 We are talking about a limit, not a value.

Step 2: What happens at zero?

Division means:

“How many times does the denominator fit into the numerator?”

Now ask:

How many times does 0 fit into 1?

There is no meaningful answer.

Not a big number

Not infinity

Not zero

There is no number that satisfies this.

That’s why mathematicians say:

1 ÷ 0 is undefined, not infinite.

Infinity describes behavior near zero,
not the result at zero.

This is a crucial distinction.

[Part 5 – Why ∞ − ∞ is meaningless | 8:30–10:00]

Now suppose infinity were a number.

Then:

∞ − ∞ = ?

∞ ÷ ∞ = ?

But here’s the problem.

Infinity does not represent a single size.

Example:

Counting numbers → infinity

Even numbers → infinity

Real numbers → a larger infinity

So when you say:

∞ − ∞

You are not subtracting two known quantities.
You are subtracting two undefined processes.

Depending on how you approach it, the result could be:

0

A finite number

Infinity

Or something else

That’s why these expressions are called indeterminate forms.

[Part 6 – Final Mental Picture | 10:00–11:30]

Let’s lock the correct image of infinity in your mind.

Infinity is not a number

It is a direction, not a destination

It describes endless growth or unboundedness

Limits can approach infinity

But values never equal infinity

And once you see infinity this way,
questions like:

“What is the biggest number?”

“Why not divide by zero?”

“Why infinity + 1 = infinity?”

stop being confusing.

They stop being mysterious.
